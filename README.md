# PracticeExpress

![First Try]()

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.


## Lessons Learned:

First time ever trying express. It was very interesting I see some great possibilities from learning this starting to open up. This is just the beginning I will be practicing this alot right now that I am learning about endpoints, routing, middleware, and anonymous functions.
