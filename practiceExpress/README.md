![Practice my Express](public/trollface.jpg)
Learned how to use Express and mondoDB and this is my first shot at a simple Express application.



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, & MondoDB
  This was my first crack at creating my own express application. I enjoyed it so I decided to practice a couple times and came up with this. This is a trolling application to anonymously troll the picture that'll be posted. The picture I chose was of young up and coming artist Tekashi 6ix9ine. Under the picture Users can comment jokes, praises, complaints, or criticism. Whatever is on your mind say it and dont be judged for it but no obscenities please.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage
