![Practice my Express](public/trollface.jpg)
Learned how to use Express and mondoDB and this is my first shot at a simple Express application.



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, & MondoDB
  This was my first crack at creating my own express application. I enjoyed it so I decided to practice a couple times and came up with this.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `npm run savage`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8000`
